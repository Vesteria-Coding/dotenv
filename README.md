# dotenv
Simple, fast and lightweight (runs about 10,000 lines in a quarter second) .env file loader written in C++ for C++.
This was inspired by others single files libraries and Python's load_dotenv() function from dotenv.

HOW TO USE:
just use `load_dotenv(FilePath)` and you are done loading the variables.
